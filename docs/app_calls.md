## Setup
The contracts are deployed with a script available in `scripts/deploy.js`

        args: [
            `secondary_token_id`,
            `liquidity_token_id`
        ]
        flags: {
            localInts: 3,
            localBytes: 0,
            globalInts: 5,
            globalBytes: 1
        };
    }
    ```
